# zells Project

This repository contains files I write or collect documents *about* the [zells](http://zells.org) project. That is until the zells itself is in a state where it's able to host these projects.

So far this includes 

- the [project log][log], where I'll write notes and thoughts that come up while working on the project. I'll announce updates on [Twitter] if you wanna follow them,

- a collection of [conferences] and meet-ups in Berlin that might be a fit for this project

- a list of [similar projects]

- a list of [use cases] to guide the prototype development.
