In the end I didn't work on zells last week and wasn't sure if I would this week since I really wanna finish my current freelance project and start working on zells full-time as soon as possible. But since the project is making good progress and today is HPI's summer fest I decided this week deserves at least half a zells day.


### A Plan

I continued thinking about how what I want to do during these months. The main question is still: what do I want the outcome to be? So far I thought writing a proposal or find other sources of funding would be the most important thing. But thinking about it during the last two weeks led me more and more to believe that the thing that is most important to me personally is the prototype. But I'm not sure if I can justify that. It feels capricious.

One reason is that I want to minimize "chance of regret". If I focused on finding funding and failed, I would very much regret not having spent more time on the prototype. If I don't manage to build a usable prototype, I would not regret having worked on it.

So my current plan is this:

	1. Describe *[Use Cases]* I want to implement (using prose and story boards)
	2. Implement the Use Cases into the prototype and record *[Demos]*
	3. Write *[Papers]* about interesting ideas and went into the prototype
	4. Build a small *Community* to iterate my ideas and implementations with
	
I already started with 1 and 2 and think 3 would be a great way for me to dig deeper into some topics and also create archive-able artifacts besides the demos. And community-wise I'm very happy being able to sit in the Software Architecture group which already gave me great ideas and feedback but I also thought about starting a "Stammtisch" or a "Software Literacy Society".
	
	
### A Goal
	
The use cases would play the role of milestones to track my progress. Not sure in what order to put them in. Especially which use case should be my goal for three months. I like Jens' idea of re-building a Bret Victor demo so I watched them all again and thought *Binary Search* from "[Inventing on Principle]" would be the most suitable one.

Especially since algorithms is something I haven't thought about in a while in this context. My current ideas involve putting the executing context in an object *space* and make its inhabitant accessible just like any other object, and keeping history of every change to support analysis and debugging. So every executing of a function (I call them *reaction*) would create a new history, possibly involving several objects. These histories can be used to navigate to the past and into possibly hypothetical futures using examples.

This is still pretty wishy washy but a story board will hopefully make it more concrete.


### An Approach

Today I didn't sit in the office but outside in the lobby. Not so great for concentration but great for listening to discussions and casually talking to other people hanging around. One of these discussion was with a researcher from Cambridge who I told about my approach of using the *Binary Search* demo as a goal. He commented that this may lead to re-creating the "magic show" that Bret's demos are which will most likely turn out to be very difficult to "make it reality". Instead he recommends to use a user-centric approach and first find actual real-world problems that people have and then use creative ideas to solve them.

The weird thing is that I am convinced that this is the better approach but I am still reluctant to follow it. So I'm having a hard time supporting this gut feeling of mine with arguments. I just feel like I need to implement a usable prototype in order to be able to imagine what would be possible to do with it. My other hope is that demoing it to people will lead me to a fitting problem. Because as long as I'm not sure about what I want to build and can't explain it to anyone, nobody stands a chance of imagining it and what kind of problems can be solved with it.

So against my knowing better, I will continue to work idea-centric and focus on implementing use cases into the prototype. But I'll definitely re-evaluate this approach regularly.
