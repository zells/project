# 2018 Week 35

### Project Planning

[18:44] Week number two Spent the morning with some project planning with my wife. She liked using demos as milestones but recommended to come up with due dates for them. Estimating time I need for them will be very difficult for me. Especially since I would need to know gross time. Re-implementing "Transmit Signal" took me all of last week. "Send Message" should take me less time. Actually I want to have something to show at the group seminar on Wednesday. But the more complex the use case, the longer it will take me to implement them.

But let's estimate a rough two weeks per use case. What would that look like:

- 2018-08-24 Transmit Signal
- 2018-09-07 Send Message
- 2018-09-21 Three plus Four
- 2018-10-05 Logo Turtles
- 2018-10-19 ?
- 2018-11-02 ?
- 2018-11-16 Binary Search

There is still a gap between "Logo Turtles" and "Binary Search", which is too big an increment. Maybe a simpler algorithm without iterations.

But having a weekly rhythm would probably help a lot with focus. Maybe I even manage to get that down to a weekly demo. But I don't want to record a demo just because a week has passed. So let's target for biweekly.

### Thoughts about Urbit

Had an update from Urbit in my Twitter time line and spent the morning commute reading and thinking some more about the project. Found a [comment on Hacker News][hackernews] which is pretty close to how I feel:

> I still have not been able to figure out if there's actually something that amazing about Urbit, or if behind the obfuscated terminology there's nothing, and I am reluctant to commit to the time required to find out for myself.

One thing that bothers me about the project is the whole way they communicate is built on idiosyncrasies and terminology that seems to be designed to be as incomprehensible to outsiders as possible. A [quote by one of the creators][goodreads] is so far the best hint I could find for why that's the case:

> [I]n many ways nonsense is a more effective organizing tool than the truth. Anyone can believe in the truth. To believe in nonsense is an unforgeable demonstration of loyalty. It serves as a political uniform. And if you have a uniform, you have an army.

The hierarchical node structure also seems suspicious to me. I think that's mainly a scheme to generate revenue by selling the limited name spaces. But I find this approach a bit short-sighted. What's the incentive for a parent node to provide service to its children?

But definitely will keep an eye on this.

### Prototype Work

The main chunk of the day I spent on the next use case, "Sending Message". After reading my notes from last week, I made [two sketches] and implemented them. Once again I was positively surprised by how straight-forward the implementation is once I have a good visual image of the user interaction.

I added names to Zells, editable via a `NameScope` and built a `SpaceZell` with `SpaceScope` to compose Zells. This way, you can create a "Message" that contains two Zells named "to" and "body". The Space also forwards each received Signal to all of its Inhabitants which then decide themselves if and how they should react to it. I also made a [file-out][file-out1] with today's changes.

### Feedback

My goal is to demo the current prototype to the group on Wednesday so I asked Marcel if he thinks it's in an appropriate state. His feedback was to make the role of the Scopes more explicit by showing how they are basically an adapter for the Zell's interface, which should only use ´receive´ for that purpose.

He also noticed how the Zells' color is used inconsistently. It looked to him like color implies identity but actually two distinct Zells can have the same color as well as the same Zell two different colors in different Scopes. So I definitely need to fix that.

Another inconsistency was Scope state. If Scopes are only there to "look into" a Zell, then they should not have their own states as in the case of the ListenerScope. But I'm not sure if I can avoid Scope state all together since Scopes will always have at least some own state like the position and size of Inhabitants in a SpaceScope. But maybe I can improve that point a bit.

He also came up with a use case for this demo. It could be simply changing the name of a Person entry with name and age. This would show how composed Zells are used to model entities as well as Messages and how Messages can be received by a single receiver or multiple.

And of course it's important to discuss the difference to Smalltalk. So far I would consider the main points to be broadcasting, first class messages, and asynchronous unidirectional messaging sending.

I should be able to incorporate these changes tomorrow.

[11:18] Goal for today: prepare prototype and probably presentation for the demo tomorrow.

More specifically:

- [X] Zell and Scope (attach/detach)
- [X] Receiver Zell and Transcript Scope
- [X] visual attachment of Scope to Zell
- [X] Text Zell and Scope
- [X] name of Zell and NameScope
- [X] ListenerScope and Serializer/Deserializer
- [X] InboxScope
- [X] Container Zell and Scope
- [X] prepare demo use case

[18:09] Completed my list but only just. Revising the whole prototype took longer than expected and in the end I struggled with Message dispatching in deeply nested structures. I used a very simple addressing system where a Message sent to "Age" is received by all Zells named "Age" and "Alice/Age" is only received by the Age of "Alice". That part definitely needs a better solution but for the demo is should suffice.

Another problem with [today's implementation][file-out2] is that I can't attach several ContainerScopes at the same ContainerZell since its inhabitants cannot be sub-Morphs of both Scopes at the same time. I suspect the root of this to have something to do with how Scopes talk to Zells. Almost everything uses Signals now but some crucial parts still talk to the Zells directly. I hope another design revision will solve that.

So tomorrow morning I should have enough time to make a presentation and plan the demo and maybe go through it once with Marcel. Looking forward to it.

### Presentation in weekly group seminar
	
[17:33] Having a deadline like my presentation really boosts my motivation. Not that it was low at any point but it's been a while since I dreamed about a project and got pushed out of bed at 6 to work on it. So the whole morning I spent drawing the [slides] and refining/practicing the demo. After lunch I gave the presentation to 6 people from the group and got some great feedback.

- it's still not very clear what problem I'm actually trying to solve but it seems to be less confusing than before
- the [list of accidental complications] is considered too long and it's suggested to pick and focus on a few
- it would help to include a comparison between Zells and other concepts, such as Objects, Actors, Function and Processes
- instead of "programming platform", a better term might be "programming environment"
- "Scope" is too loaded with meaning in the programming language domain

I realized once again how much presenting my ideas helps me to clarify them. I tend to get stuck in my own thinking, so I'm very happy to be able to bounce ideas off of my colleagues here.

### Drag-n-Drop Bug

Attaching a Scope to a Zell via drag-n-drop did not work consistently during the demonstration so afterwards Marcel helped me to debug. Once again, this was a great chance to get to know the Squeak internals a bit better. In the end it was a combination of how mouse events are dispatched to the objects and where I place my objects. Took a while to find the root cause but together we managed to fix it and drag-n-drop works like a charm now.

### Mech and the Point of it

During my presentation, one of my colleagues said my demo reminded him of [Mech] which I hadn't heard about so I made a note to check it out. Turns out during the presentation, a certain "Corey" joined the *Future Programming* Slack group who turns out to be the author of Mech.

So I read the [blog][mech-blog] and watched the [demo][mech-demo] and I'm very thrilled to have found another project for my [list][similar-projects]. I was always impressed by the demo and can't even imagine how much work it is to get this all working.

But I think I also understand the question of my colleague who pointed my to Mech which was "Which problem are you trying to solve?", because I had a similar sentiment when I watched Corey's demo. Kinda like "What's the point of this?" which I'm sure is what many people think when I tell them about zells.

I think the main value of these demos is not to show a tool or model that makes everything better, but to give a glimpse of possibilities, of new directions. Having a "point" to it, might be too much of a burden and smother creativity.

But at some point, a project has to shed this *puppy license* and strive towards more scientific rigor, proving that it is more useful, at least within certain constraints.

## 2018-08-30

A short zells day since I was asked to help my previous project experienced critical anomalies. In the end I was unable to find the problem but whatever it was, a restart made it go away. Quite depressing.
All I did was to prepare recording the demo from Wednesday. I wrote and rehearsed a [script] and found a set-up that would allow me to record the whole thing in multiple segments, to I only have to re-record a short part if I screw up. Should speed up the the whole process significantly. A great help was being able to create check points by saving the image. This way, I could simply jump back to the exact state at the end of the last segment.


For future reference: I'm using [Simple Screen Recorder] and [Kdenlive] on Ubuntu 16.04.
