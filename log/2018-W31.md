# 2018 Week 31

Having notes is definitely very helpful for picking up where I left things two weeks ago. I still like [the plan] of using demos of use cases to drive the implementation of a prototype, while recording interesting aspects and ideas in video and text. The texts won't necessarily be scientific papers though although I would prefer them to be.

I want to be as [human-centered] as I can so building a community to test and iterate on my ideas will be very important. Not sure how to tackle that yet, though. So far, I have a couple of people I emailed with a couple of times, great people in the [Future of Programming Slack group] and my temporary colleagues at HPI. I'm also thinking of starting a "Stammtisch" to get to know more local people interested in these topics.

The goal is still [the same]: implementing something similar to the "[Binary Search]" demo fo [Bret Victor]. And since I want to create story boards and paper prototypes for each use case before I start implementing anything, so I can iterate on them using feedback from the community, I thought about starting with a story board for this use case. I'm not completely sure if that might not be too big a bite but even if, it might still be a good exercise to harden and find week points in the whole design.

I'm gonna give myself 13 weeks (starting 2018-08-20) to reach this goal and will then evaluate if I want to continue or not.

To organize my work, I started a [board] on Trello, and in the spirit of this exercise in transparency, made it public. The first thing I wanna do, probably until the 20th, is to extract the part about the accidental complication from the [Manifesto] and elaborate a little more on the other parts, as suggested by a friend of mine after an in-depth discussion about this document.

Seconds zells day in a row. Since I starting end of August, I hope to spend many many consecutive days on this project, I decided to group this log into weeks since daily updates feel too frequent. So I'll announce updates weekly, linking to the document of the week.

Today I added some tasks to the "later" column of the [board]. These are things I'm not sure when of even if to do but it's good to have them somewhere, given that they are not too numerous. Mostly hose-keeping things but also the idea of founding a physical or even legal group to organize a community. Incidentally, Steven Krouse just posted an [essay about his virtual community of dissenters][sissies] which expressed exactly my notion. So instead of forming a physical group, I should probably get more involved with existing virtual ones.

The rest of the day I struggled with revising the manifesto. I managed to jot down a *very* [rough draft] but then a writer's block hit me and I couldn't find any good formulations of my thoughts. So I decided to let it rest and checked-out the book shelf instead where I found "Sketching the User Experience" which, after reading a couple of pages, sounds like a perfect match of helping me figuring out how to sketch storyboards for use cases.

Now I'll find out if writing this log warmed me up enough to continue formulating the Manifesto. If not I'll just continue reading the book.

I watched part of some talks from the Decentralized Web Summit which took place during the last two days and thankfully published recordings. To my surprised, I did not succeed in finding a connection to the presented topics. And I just couldn't figure out, why. Will have to meditate on it and maybe watch more of the talks to get a better feeling.

Yesterday I asked Marcel what he thought of my plan and he said focusing on demos was a good idea but suggested that I concentrate on a smaller part, maybe a single complication that exists in Squeak and how it could be solved.

This got me thinking about my list of accidental complications - which I extracted from the manifesto in Wednesday. Looking at the original list from 2016 and the [comparison] of software platforms based on complications, I realized that the list and also the definition has changed quite a bit. So I thought a good first step would be to revise definitions and criteria for each complication and validate them with my peers. If they form the base hypothesis of this whole project, I should put some effort into finding out if other people see it the same way. So I started a new [list of accidental complications] and hope I'll be able to present it at the group seminar after my vacation.
