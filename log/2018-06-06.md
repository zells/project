First day as visiting researcher. It was a fantastic day. Unfortunately my current freelance project has some loose ends I need to tie up before I can leave with piece of mind so the upcoming weeks I'll probably will only be able to do spend day per week on zells. The real sabatical is moved to July - October. I want to use June to collect and read literature on the potential research topics that I wrote down last time.

My goals for today were

- find out who is going to ECOOP and if there might be a chance to get a ticket sponsored
- get feedback on the research topics
- write down first use case for prototype eight

and I actually managed to do all three. 

### ECOOP 2018

Unfortunately there is no way to get a sponsored ticket to ECOOP but some people are indeed going so if I decide to fly to Amsterdam these days I at least have some contacts. So I think I have to just write Alan Kay if there is any chance that I could have a quick chat with him while he's there. Scary but definitely worth the try. I won't go unless there is actually a chance of meeting him.

### Feedback on research topic ideas

Spent the morning in a very inspiring conversation about the research topics I wrote down in the [last log]. The overall impression that I got is that these things are actually valid topics and there is some research to be found on them. The list I got from him is

- Boxer: A Reconstructible Computational Medium
- Fleissner: Harmony-Oriented Smalltalk
- Tanimoto: A Perspective on the Evolution of Live Programming
- Church: Liveness becomes Entelechy - A scheme for L6
- Ingalls: Design Principles behind Smalltalk
- Nardi: A Small Matter of Programming: Perspectives on End User Computing
- Smith: Designing the Star User Interface
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dimensions_of_notations

My goal until next week to read at least three of these and maybe at least the abstracts of the rest.

Further feedback/ideas I got from him are:

- he knows a master student (David Rauch) who works on the topic "always debugging"
- he created a literature study of live programming
- I should check out newspeak again
- I should also have a closer look at Lively 4 again
	- try out to mount dropbox, github
	- look at how every object can represent itself
- re: purely asynchronous languages
	- all message passing languages are asynchronous
	- eg erlang, elixir, scala
	- only works above a certain level, painful for lower level
	- eg implementing Fibonacci with message passing is painful
	- a consequence is this puts data flow over control flow (what are the implications of this?)
- he recommended JabRef to manage my bibliography
- we also talked about the "academia vs. industry" topic
	- GB academia has to include outreach plans
	- the advantage of not having to search for an actual user problem is that you can run experiments way cheaper since you build it only for yourself and write it down
	

### Prototype Eight

I wrote down a first use case which is the most minimal that I could come up with. My project structure is a bit of a mess currently so I don't have a place to put it yet. I'll probably create a repository for the prototype and will put it there. I'll put the location here as soon as it exists.


### Post Scriptum

Turns out a huge advantage of the long commute is that I have a whole hour to write these long entries after leaving the office. So I might continue taking the train.
