# 2018 Week 50

It's already February and I just realized I have never written the log of last year's last week. So here are some very few words of what I remember.

Since I spent a couple of days in Munich I was able to arrange a meeting with [Prof. Heinz Mandl][mandl] who supervised my dad's PhD and is an expert in the constructivist learning theory. He supported my thesis that simulation building would be a great way of implementing this theory which gave me a great motivational boost. He also gave prinouts of three of his papers which I put on top of my reading list.

I also started a new revision of the proposal but got stuck again and again. I'm quite happy with the outline and general structure but the words don't come out. So that was frustrating.

More uplifting was my email conversation with Jamie Brandon who shares many of my believes and is working on a very similar project, named [Beach]. Can't wait to see more of it.
